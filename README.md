In the game we have a player who can walk to a sign post to start his first "quest" and after walking over the sign he is greeted with a page with some text about his problem and is given a input form that both you and your friends can change.

After entering the answer there is some text saying, your dc (meaning luck) and if your dc is low then you will have bad luck, which might lead you to your death.
