# Dungeons-A.I
Welcome to Dongeons-A.I, this project is about a person who is greeted with a question and can type in his answer, then a dc will be calculated and this will effect if you will either live or die. High Dc means a higher number must be obtained.
First of all this game is multiplay to enhance the game experience, and to allow you the play with your friends. The first two images show entering username and entering the game id, either create or join

In the game we have a player who can walk to a sign post to start his first "quest" and after walking over the sign he is greeted with a page with some text about his problem and is given a input form that both you and your friends can change.

After entering the answer, text will be displayed showing how much one must roll to succeed on the check. High Dc means a higher number must be obtained.
